1. Class Definition (Bike):
Static Properties:

public static $bikename: A static property representing the bike's name, set to 'ContinentalGT650'.
public static $price: A static property representing the bike's price, set to '425000'.
public static $enginecc: A static property representing the bike's engine capacity, set to '648cc'.
Static properties belong to the class itself, rather than any individual instance of the class.

Static Method (bike()):

This method returns a string that combines the static properties ($bikename, $enginecc, and $price) into a descriptive sentence about the bike.
self::$bikename and similar expressions are used to access static properties from within the static method.

2. Class Definition (Color):
Inheritance:

The Color class extends the Bike class, meaning it inherits the static properties and methods from Bike.
Static Property:

public static $color: A static property specific to the Color class, representing the color of the bike, set to 'chrome'.
Static Method (color()):

This method returns a string indicating the color of the bike, using the static property $color from the Color class.

3. Method Calls:
Color::color():

Calls the color() method from the Color class, which outputs: " your choies is chrome color ".
Color::bike():

Calls the bike() method from the Bike class, which outputs: "ContinentalGT650 is a 648cc bike and its price is 425000.".

Summary:
Static Properties and Methods:

Static properties and static methods belong to the class itself, not to any instance of the class. They are accessed using the :: operator.
self:: is used within a class to access its own static properties and methods.
Inheritance:

The Color class inherits static properties and methods from the Bike class. Thus, it can call the bike() method from the Bike class and access static properties of Bike.
Accessing Static Properties and Methods:

self::: Refers to static properties and methods within the same class.
static::: (Not used here but worth noting) Can be used in the context of late static bindings to refer to the class that was called.
Explanation of $this vs. self:
$this:

Used to refer to the current instance of a class.
Applicable in instance methods (non-static methods) to access instance properties and methods.
self:

Used to refer to the current class itself, not an instance.
Applicable in static methods or when accessing static properties and methods. It helps to access static members of the class.
